# Hill--Racer
Hill Racer is a physics based driving game that allows a user to navigate a car across a hill terrain. Along the way,  the user must avoid boulders, climb steep hills, and collect power ups. This game is a race against time, as the car must reach the end of the path before its fuel tank runs out of gas!
